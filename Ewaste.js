              <b>RELIANCE RETAIL E-WASTE RECYCLING POLICY</b>
            </h4>
            <p>
              The Information and Communication revolution has brought enormous
              changes in the way we organize our lives, our economies,
              industries and institutions. These spectacular developments in
              modern times have undoubtedly enhanced the quality of our lives,
              but at the same time, have led to manifold problems including the
              problem of massive amount of hazardous waste and other waste
              generated from electric products. Such waste poses a serious
              threat to human health and environment. The issue of proper
              management of such hazardous E-Waste is therefore critical to the
              protection of livelihood, health and environment.
            </p>
            <p>
              To deal with this ever-rising problem of E-Waste, the government
              of India, through its Ministry of Environment and forest,
              formulated the E-Waste (Management and Handling) Rules in 2011.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>
                RELIANCE RETAIL STANDS COMMITTED TO IMPLEMENT THE E-WASTE RULES.

              Like hazardous waste, the problem of e-waste has become an
              immediate and long-term concern as its unregulated accumulation
              and recycling can lead to major environmental problems endangering
              human health. This calls for an urgent need for E-Waste Management
              so as to preserve the ecological balance and reduce landfills.
              Recycling end-of-life products is vital if we are to save
              resources and minimize waste. In this regard, we at Reliance
              Retail have tied up with Reteck Envirotech Pvt. Ltd, one of the
              world's largest authorized E-Waste recycler, for facilitating our
              Organization and our customers to enable them to dispose E-Waste
              products after its end-of-life.
              <br />
              <br />
              AS AN ENVIRONMENTALLY CONSCIOUS ORGANISATION, RELIANCE RETAIL HAS
              INITIATED VARIOUS ACTIVITIES TO PROMOTE E-WASTE RECYCLING.
              <br />
              <br />
              100% recycling and disposal through authorized recycler to avoid
              the adverse effects of E-Waste.

              <b>Conserve Resources</b>
            </h6>
            <p>
              Creation requires raw resources. But when we recycle, extant
              material is put to use. Recycling saves this extraction of the
              fresh raw resources, and revives the existing ones that are no
              longer of use. This way there is lesser exploitation and more
              conservation of natural resources.
            </p>
            <h6>
              <b>Save Energy</b>
            </h6>
            <p>
              Each time we recycle a product, it requires lesser energy than
              producing a new one from the scratch. The considerable difference
              in manufacturing time is a result of skipping the usual process of
              extraction of raw material, its transportation, refining etc.,
              which is way more than having a market ready product that to have
              a raw material ready for production.
            </p>
            <h6>
              <b>Prevent Pollution</b>
            </h6>
            <p>
              Production and disposal of products require a great deal of
              extraction, refining, processing and dumping of material, which
              have larger impact on the environment. By recycling, we cut down
              the pollution of air, water and land, thus reducing the greenhouse
              gas emission and avoiding any contribution to global warming.
